# Cryptocurrency TUREX BEP-20

CREATING A TUREX TOKEN IN THE Binance Smart Chain NETWORK

On August 11, 2021, TUREX MONEY decided to create a TUREX token on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain.

Advantages of the Binance Smart Chain Blockchain:
- Fast transactions
- Low commissions

TUREX ERC-20 tokens will be completely withdrawn from the circulation of the community and replaced with TUREX BEP-20 tokens.

Starting from October 1, 2021, TUREX ERC-20 tokens will no longer be supported by the TUREX MONEY ecosystem.
